An implementation of Hierarchical Page Tables in c++
should be run an a Linux environment.

VMinitialize() – will be called before any other function is called.

VMread(uint64_t virtualAddress, word_t* value) – reads the word from the virtual
address virtualAddress into *value. Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

VMwrite(uint64_t virtualAddress, word_t value) – writes the word value into the virtual
address virtualAddress. Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

PMread(uint64_t physicalAddress, word_t* value) – reads the word from the physical
address phsyicalAddress into *value.

PMwrite(uint64_t physicalAddress, word_t value) – writes the word value into the
physical address phsyicalAddress.

PMevict(uint64_t frameIndex, uint64_t evictedPageIndex) – evicts the page
evictedPageIndex from the frame frameIndex in the physical memory and stores it in the
simulated hard drive.

PMrestore(uint64_t frameIndex, uint64_t restoredPageIndex) – restores the page
restoredPageIndex from the simulated hard drive i
